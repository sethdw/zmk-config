# Seth's ZMK Layouts

# corneish_zen.keymap
This is a modified version of [the Pnohty layout](https://github.com/rayduck/pnohty). I do not suggest anyone uses it because I've got used to using hjkl as arrow keys, but where colemak puts them, which is very unergonomic. 

# corne.keymap
This is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org">miryoku layout</a> for the corne keyboard using the ZMK Firmware.

It modifies miryoku in that it removes the dedicated layer for mouse movements and shifted numbers as ZMK did not support these fully at the time of implementation, and I didn't want them anyway.
